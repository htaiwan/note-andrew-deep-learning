<h3 id="1">1 - Problem Statement</h3>

> - If you have 80 classes that you want YOLO to recognize, you can represent the class label  cc  either as an integer from 1 to 80, or as an 80-dimensional vector (with 80 numbers) one component of which is 1 and the rest of which are 0. 
> 
> - The video lectures had used the latter representation; in this notebook, we will use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.
>
> - In this exercise, you will learn how YOLO works, then apply it to car detection. Because the YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train, we will load pre-trained weights for you to use.

<h3 id="2">2 - YOLO</h3>

> - YOLO ("you only look once") is a popular algoritm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. 
> 
> - It requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.

<h3 id="2.1">2.1 - Model details</h3>

> ![figure2](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/??.png)
> 
> > - The **input** is a batch of images of shape (m, 608, 608, 3)
> > - The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers. 

> ![figure3](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/??.png)
> 
> > - For simplicity, we will flatten the last two last dimensions of the shape (19, 19, 5, 85) encoding. So the output of the Deep CNN is (19, 19, 425).
> 
> ![figure4](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/??.png)
> 
> ![figure5](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/??.png)
> 
> > - For each of the 19x19 grid cells, find the maximum of the probability scores (taking a max across both the 5 anchor boxes and across different classes).
> > - Color that grid cell according to what object that grid cell considers the most likely.
> 
> ![figure6](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/??.png)
> 
> > - Each cell gives you 5 boxes. In total, the model predicts: 19x19x5 = 1805 boxes just by looking once at the image (one forward pass through the network)! Different colors denote different classes.
> > - In the figure above, we plotted only boxes that the model had assigned a high probability to, but this is still too many boxes. You'd like to filter the algorithm's output down to a much smaller number of detected objects. To do so, you'll use **non-max suppression**.
> > - [non-max suppression的計算步骤?](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Note/4-3.md#3.7.2)
> > 
> > > - Get rid of boxes with a low score (meaning, the box is not very confident about detecting a class)
> > > - Select only one box when several boxes overlap with each other and detect the same object.

<h3 id="2.2">2.2 - Filtering with a threshold on class scores</h3>

> - The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85 numbers. It'll be convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425)) dimensional tensor into the following variables:
>
> > - box_confidence: tensor of shape  (19×19,5,1)(19×19,5,1)  containing  pcpc  (confidence probability that there's some object) for each of the 5 boxes predicted in each of the 19x19 cells.
> > - boxes: tensor of shape  (19×19,5,4)(19×19,5,4)  containing  (bx,by,bh,bw)(bx,by,bh,bw)  for each of the 5 boxes per cell.
> > - box_class_probs: tensor of shape  (19×19,5,80)(19×19,5,80)  containing the detection probabilities  (c1,c2,...c80)(c1,c2,...c80)  for each of the 80 classes for each of the 5 boxes per cell.

**Exercise**: Implement `yolo_filter_boxes()`.

1. Compute box scores by doing the elementwise product as described in Figure 4. The following code may help you choose the right operator: 
```python
a = np.random.randn(19*19, 5, 1)
b = np.random.randn(19*19, 5, 80)
c = a * b # shape of c will be (19*19, 5, 80)
```
2. For each box, find:
    - the index of the class with the maximum box score ([Hint](https://keras.io/backend/#argmax)) (Be careful with what axis you choose; consider using axis=-1)
    - the corresponding box score ([Hint](https://keras.io/backend/#max)) (Be careful with what axis you choose; consider using axis=-1)
3. Create a mask by using a threshold. As a reminder: `([0.9, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.1] < 0.4)` returns: `[False, True, False, False, True]`. The mask should be True for the boxes you want to keep. 
4. Use TensorFlow to apply the mask to box_class_scores, boxes and box_classes to filter out the boxes we don't want. You should be left with just the subset of boxes you want to keep. ([Hint](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/boolean_mask))

Reminder: to call a Keras function, you should use `K.function(...)`.

> - Even after filtering by thresholding over the classes scores, you still end up a lot of overlapping boxes. A second filter for selecting the right boxes is called non-maximum suppression (NMS).
> 
> - Non-max suppression uses the very important function called "Intersection over Union", or IoU.
> - [IOU算法的功用?](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Note/4-3.md#3.6.1)

**Exercise**: Implement iou(). Some hints:

- In this exercise only, we define a box using its two corners (upper left and lower right): (x1, y1, x2, y2) rather than the midpoint and height/width.
- To calculate the area of a rectangle you need to multiply its height (y2 - y1) by its width (x2 - x1)
- You'll also need to find the coordinates (xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2) of the intersection of two boxes. Remember that:
    - xi1 = maximum of the x1 coordinates of the two boxes
    - yi1 = maximum of the y1 coordinates of the two boxes
    - xi2 = minimum of the x2 coordinates of the two boxes
    - yi2 = minimum of the y2 coordinates of the two boxes
    
In this code, we use the convention that (0,0) is the top-left corner of an image, (1,0) is the upper-right corner, and (1,1) the lower-right corner. 

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: iou

def iou(box1, box2):

    return iou
```

> You are now ready to implement non-max suppression. The key steps are:
 
> - 1. Select the box that has the highest score.
> - 2. Compute its overlap with all other boxes, and remove boxes that overlap it more than `iou_threshold`.
> - 3. Go back to step 1 and iterate until there's no more boxes with a lower score than the current selected box.
>
> This will remove all boxes that have a large overlap with the selected boxes. Only the "best" boxes remain.

**Exercise**: Implement yolo_non_max_suppression() using TensorFlow.

TensorFlow has two built-in functions that are used to implement non-max suppression (so you don't actually need to use your `iou()` implementation):

- [tf.image.non_max_suppression()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression)
- [K.gather()](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/gather)

<h3 id="2.4">2.4 - Wrapping up the filtering</h3>

**Exercise**: Implement `yolo_eval()` which takes the output of the YOLO encoding and filters the boxes using score threshold and NMS. There's just one last implementational detail you have to know. There're a few ways of representing boxes, such as via their corners or via their midpoint and height/width. YOLO converts between a few such formats at different times, using the following functions (which we have provided): 

```python
boxes = yolo_boxes_to_corners(box_xy, box_wh) 
```
which converts the yolo box coordinates (x,y,w,h) to box corners' coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2) to fit the input of `yolo_filter_boxes`
```python
boxes = scale_boxes(boxes, image_shape)
```
YOLO's network was trained to run on 608x608 images. If you are testing this data on a different size image--for example, the car detection dataset had 720x1280 images--this step rescales the boxes so that they can be plotted on top of the original 720x1280 image.  

Don't worry about these two functions; we'll show you where they need to be called.

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: yolo_eval

def yolo_eval(yolo_outputs, image_shape = (720., 1280.), max_boxes=10, score_threshold=.6, iou_threshold=.5):
    """

<h3 id="2.5">Summary for YOLO</h3>

> **Summary for YOLO**:
>
> - Input image (608, 608, 3)
> 
> - The input image goes through a CNN, resulting in a (19,19,5,85) dimensional output.
>  
> - After flattening the last two dimensions, the output is a volume of shape (19, 19, 425):
> 
> >    - Each cell in a 19x19 grid over the input image gives 425 numbers. 
> >
> >    - 425 = 5 x 85 because each cell contains predictions for 5 boxes, corresponding to 5 anchor boxes, as seen in lecture. 
> >
> >    - 85 = 5 + 80 where 5 is because $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ has 5 numbers, and and 80 is the number of classes we'd like to detect

> > 
> >   - Non-max suppression: Compute the Intersection over Union and avoid selecting overlapping boxes
> 
> - This gives you YOLO's final output.


<h3 id="3.1">3.1 - Defining classes, anchors and image shape</h3>

> - Recall that we are trying to detect 80 classes, and are using 5 anchor boxes. 
> - We have gathered the information about the 80 classes and 5 boxes in two files "coco_classes.txt" and "yolo_anchors.txt". Let's load these quantities into the model by running the next cell.
> - The car detection dataset has 720x1280 images, which we've pre-processed into 608x608 images.

```python
class_names = read_classes("model_data/coco_classes.txt")
anchors = read_anchors("model_data/yolo_anchors.txt")
image_shape = (720., 1280.)  
```

<h3 id="3.2">3.2 - Loading a pretrained model</h3>

> - Training a YOLO model takes a very long time and requires a fairly large dataset of labelled bounding boxes for a large range of target classes. 
> - You are going to load an existing pretrained Keras YOLO model stored in "yolo.h5".

```python
yolo_model = load_model("model_data/yolo.h5")
yolo_model.summary() 
```

<h3 id="3.3">3.3 - Convert output of the model to usable bounding box tensors</h3>

> - The output of yolo_model is a (m, 19, 19, 5, 85) tensor that needs to pass through non-trivial processing and conversion.

```python
yolo_outputs = yolo_head(yolo_model.output, anchors, len(class_names)) 
```

<h3 id="3.4">3.4 - Filtering boxes</h3>

> - yolo_outputs gave you all the predicted boxes of yolo_model in the correct format. 
> - You're now ready to perform filtering and select only the best boxes. Lets now call yolo_eval,

```python
scores, boxes, classes = yolo_eval(yolo_outputs, image_shape)
```

<h3 id="3.5">3.5 - Run the graph on an image</h3>

> - You have created a (`sess`) graph that can be summarized as follows:
>
> > 1. <font color='purple'> yolo_model.input </font> is given to `yolo_model`. The model is used to compute the output <font color='purple'> yolo_model.output </font>
> > 2. <font color='purple'> yolo_model.output </font> is processed by `yolo_head`. It gives you <font color='purple'> yolo_outputs </font>
> > 3. <font color='purple'> yolo_outputs </font> goes through a filtering function, `yolo_eval`. It outputs your predictions: <font color='purple'> scores, boxes, classes </font>

**Exercise**: Implement predict() which runs the graph to test YOLO on an image.
You will need to run a TensorFlow session, to have it compute `scores, boxes, classes`.

The code below also uses the following function:

```python
image, image_data = preprocess_image("images/" + image_file, model_image_size = (608, 608))
```

which outputs:

- image: a python (PIL) representation of your image used for drawing boxes. You won't need to use it.
- image_data: a numpy-array representing the image. This will be the input to the CNN.

**Important note**: when a model uses BatchNorm (as is the case in YOLO), you will need to pass an additional placeholder in the feed_dict {K.learning_phase(): 0}.

```python
def predict(sess, image_file):
    """
    Runs the graph stored in "sess" to predict boxes for "image_file". Prints and plots the preditions.
    
    Arguments:
    sess -- your tensorflow/Keras session containing the YOLO graph

    Returns:
    out_scores -- tensor of shape (None, ), scores of the predicted boxes
    out_boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), coordinates of the predicted boxes
    out_classes -- tensor of shape (None, ), class index of the predicted boxes
    
    Note: "None" actually represents the number of predicted boxes, it varies between 0 and max_boxes. 
    """

    # Preprocess your image
    image, image_data = preprocess_image("images/" + image_file, model_image_size = (608, 608))

    # You'll need to use feed_dict={yolo_model.input: ... , K.learning_phase(): 0})
    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 1 line)
    out_scores, out_boxes, out_classes = sess.run([scores, boxes, classes], feed_dict={yolo_model.input: image_data, K.learning_phase(): 0})
    ### END CODE HERE ###

    # Print predictions info
    print('Found {} boxes for {}'.format(len(out_boxes), image_file))
    # Generate colors for drawing bounding boxes.
    colors = generate_colors(class_names)
    # Draw bounding boxes on the image file
    draw_boxes(image, out_scores, out_boxes, out_classes, class_names, colors)
    # Save the predicted bounding box on the image
    image.save(os.path.join("out", image_file), quality=90)
    # Display the results in the notebook
    output_image = scipy.misc.imread(os.path.join("out", image_file))
    imshow(output_image)
    
    return out_scores, out_boxes, out_classes
```

<h3 id="4">What you should remember</h3>

> **What you should remember**:

> - YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate
> - It runs an input image through a CNN which outputs a 19x19x5x85 dimensional volume. 
> - The encoding can be seen as a grid where each of the 19x19 cells contains information about 5 boxes.
> - You filter through all the boxes using non-max suppression. Specifically: 
> 
> >    - Score thresholding on the probability of detecting a class to keep only accurate (high probability) boxes
> >    - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxes
> 
> - Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, we used previously trained model parameters in this exercise. If you wish, you can also try fine-tuning the YOLO model with your own dataset, though this would be a fairly non-trivial exercise.
