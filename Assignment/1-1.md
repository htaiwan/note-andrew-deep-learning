<h3 id="1">1 - Packages</h3>

> First, let's run the cell below to import all the packages that you will need during this assignment. 
>
> - [numpy](www.numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
> - [h5py](http://www.h5py.org) is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file.
> - [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
> - [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end.

<h3 id="2">2 - Overview of the Problem set</h3>

> **Problem Statement**: You are given a dataset ("data.h5") containing:
> 
>    - a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
>    - a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat
>    - each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px).
>
> You will build a simple image-recognition algorithm that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

```python
# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)
train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y, classes = load_dataset()

# Example of a picture
index = 25
plt.imshow(train_set_x_orig[index])
print ("y = " + str(train_set_y[:,index]) + ", it's a '" + classes[np.squeeze(train_set_y[:,index])].decode("utf-8") +  "' picture.")

# y = [1], it's a 'cat' picture.
```

<h3 id="2.1">2.1 - Exercise</h3>

> **Exercise:** Find the values for:
> 
>    - m_train (number of training examples)
>    - m_test (number of test examples)
>    - num_px (= height = width of a training image)
>
> Remember that `train_set_x_orig` is a numpy-array of shape (m_train, num_px, num_px, 3). For instance, you can access `m_train` by writing `train_set_x_orig.shape[0]`.

```python
### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 3 lines of code)
m_train = train_set_y.shape[1]
m_test = test_set_y.shape[1]
num_px = train_set_x_orig.shape[1]
### END CODE HERE ###

print ("Number of training examples: m_train = " + str(m_train))
print ("Number of testing examples: m_test = " + str(m_test))
print ("Height/Width of each image: num_px = " + str(num_px))
print ("Each image is of size: (" + str(num_px) + ", " + str(num_px) + ", 3)")
print ("train_set_x shape: " + str(train_set_x_orig.shape))
print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))
print ("test_set_x shape: " + str(test_set_x_orig.shape))
print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape))
```

```
Number of training examples: m_train = 209
Number of testing examples: m_test = 50
Height/Width of each image: num_px = 64
Each image is of size: (64, 64, 3)
train_set_x shape: (209, 64, 64, 3)
train_set_y shape: (1, 209)
test_set_x shape: (50, 64, 64, 3)
test_set_y shape: (1, 50)
```

<h3 id="2.2">2.2 - Exercise</h3>

> **Exercise:** Reshape the training and test data sets so that images of size (num_px, num_px, 3) are flattened into single vectors of shape (num\_px $*$ num\_px $*$ 3, 1).
>
> A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b$*$c$*$d, a) is to use: 

```python
X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T      # X.T is the transpose of X
```

```python
# Reshape the training and test examples

### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 2 lines of code)
train_set_x_flatten = train_set_x_orig.reshape(train_set_x_orig.shape[0], -1).T
test_set_x_flatten = test_set_x_orig.reshape(test_set_x_orig.shape[0], -1).T
### END CODE HERE ###

# Let's standardize our dataset
train_set_x = train_set_x_flatten / 255.
test_set_x = test_set_x_flatten / 255.

print ("train_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(train_set_x_flatten.shape))
print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))
print ("test_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(test_set_x_flatten.shape))
print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape))
print ("sanity check after reshaping: " + str(train_set_x_flatten[0:5,0]))
```
```
train_set_x_flatten shape: (12288, 209)
train_set_y shape: (1, 209)
test_set_x_flatten shape: (12288, 50)
test_set_y shape: (1, 50)
sanity check after reshaping: [17 31 56 22 33]
```

<h3 id="2.3">2.3 -  What you need to remember</h3>

> **What you need to remember:**
>
> Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
>
> - Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
> - Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px \* num_px \* 3, 1)
> - "Standardize" the data


<h3 id="3">3 -  General Architecture of the learning algorithm</h3>

> ![133](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/133.png)
>
> **Key steps**:
> In this exercise, you will carry out the following steps: 
> 
>    - Initialize the parameters of the model
>    - Learn the parameters for the model by minimizing the cost  
>    - Use the learned parameters to make predictions (on the test set)
>    - Analyse the results and conclude


<h3 id="4">4 -  Building the parts of our algorithm</h3>

> The main steps for building a Neural Network are:
>
> 1. Define the model structure (such as number of input features) 
> 2. Initialize the model's parameters
> 3. Loop:
>    - Calculate current loss (forward propagation)
>    - Calculate current gradient (backward propagation)
>    - Update parameters (gradient descent)
>
> You often build 1-3 separately and integrate them into one function we call `model()`.

<h3 id="4.1">4.1 -  Helper functions</h3>

>
> **Exercise**: Using your code from "Python Basics", implement `sigmoid()`. As you've seen in the figure above, you need to compute $sigmoid( w^T x + b)$ to make predictions.

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: sigmoid

def sigmoid(z):
    """
    Compute the sigmoid of z

    Arguments:
    x -- A scalar or numpy array of any size.

    Return:
    s -- sigmoid(z)
    """

    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 1 line of code)
    s = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return s
```

<h3 id="4.2">4.2 -  Initializing parameters</h3>

>
> **Exercise:** Implement parameter initialization in the cell below. You have to initialize w as a vector of zeros. If you don't know what numpy function to use, look up np.zeros() in the Numpy library's documentation.

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: initialize_with_zeros

def initialize_with_zeros(dim):
    """
    This function creates a vector of zeros of shape (dim, 1) for w and initializes b to 0.
    
    Argument:
    dim -- size of the w vector we want (or number of parameters in this case)
    
    Returns:
    w -- initialized vector of shape (dim, 1)
    b -- initialized scalar (corresponds to the bias)
    """
    
    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 1 line of code)
    w = np.zeros(shape=(dim, 1))
    b = 0
    ### END CODE HERE ###

    assert(w.shape == (dim, 1))
    assert(isinstance(b, float) or isinstance(b, int))
    
    return w, b
```

<h3 id="4.3">4.3 -  Forward and Backward propagation</h3>

> ![134](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Asset/134.png)
>

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: propagate

def propagate(w, b, X, Y):
    """
    Implement the cost function and its gradient for the propagation explained above

    Arguments:
    w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)

    X -- data of size (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)
    Y -- true "label" vector (containing 0 if non-cat, 1 if cat) of size (1, number of examples)

    Return:
    cost -- negative log-likelihood cost for logistic regression
    dw -- gradient of the loss with respect to w, thus same shape as w
    db -- gradient of the loss with respect to b, thus same shape as b
    
    Tips:
    - Write your code step by step for the propagation
    """
    
    m = X.shape[1]
    
    # FORWARD PROPAGATION (FROM X TO COST)
    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 2 lines of code)

<h3 id="4.4">4.4 -  Optimization</h3>

>
> - You have initialized your parameters.
> - You are also able to compute a cost function and its gradient.
> - Now, you want to update the parameters using gradient descent.
> 
> **Exercise:** Write down the optimization function. The goal is to learn $w$ and $b$ by minimizing the cost function $J$. For a parameter $\theta$, the update rule is $ \theta = \theta - \alpha \text{ } d\theta$, where $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: optimize

def optimize(w, b, X, Y, num_iterations, learning_rate, print_cost = False):
    """
    This function optimizes w and b by running a gradient descent algorithm

    costs -- list of all the costs computed during the optimization, this will be used to plot the learning curve.
    
    Tips:
    You basically need to write down two steps and iterate through them:
        1) Calculate the cost and the gradient for the current parameters. Use propagate().
        2) Update the parameters using gradient descent rule for w and b.

<h3 id="4.5">4.5 - predict</h3>

> **Exercise:** The previous function will output the learned w and b. We are able to use w and b to predict the labels for a dataset X. Implement the `predict()` function. There is two steps to computing predictions:
>
> 1. Calculate $\hat{Y} = A = \sigma(w^T X + b)$
>
> 2. Convert the entries of a into 0 (if activation <= 0.5) or 1 (if activation > 0.5), stores the predictions in a vector `Y_prediction`. If you wish, you can use an `if`/`else` statement in a `for` loop (though there is also a way to vectorize this).

<h3 id="6.1">6.1 - Choice of learning rate</h3>

> **Reminder**:
> 
> In order for Gradient Descent to work you must choose the learning rate wisely. The learning rate $\alpha$  determines how rapidly we update the parameters. If the learning rate is too large we may "overshoot" the optimal value. Similarly, if it is too small we will need too many iterations to converge to the best values. That's why it is crucial to use a well-tuned learning rate.

```python
learning_rates = [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]
models = {}
for i in learning_rates:
    print ("learning rate is: " + str(i))
    models[str(i)] = model(train_set_x, train_set_y, test_set_x, test_set_y, num_iterations = 1500, learning_rate = i, print_cost = False)
    print ('\n' + "-------------------------------------------------------" + '\n')

for i in learning_rates:
    plt.plot(np.squeeze(models[str(i)]["costs"]), label= str(models[str(i)]["learning_rate"]))

plt.ylabel('cost')
plt.xlabel('iterations')

legend = plt.legend(loc='upper center', shadow=True)
frame = legend.get_frame()
frame.set_facecolor('0.90')
plt.show()
```

```
learning rate is: 0.01
train accuracy: 99.52153110047847 %
test accuracy: 68.0 %

learning rate is: 0.001
train accuracy: 88.99521531100478 %

-------------------------------------------------------

learning rate is: 0.0001
train accuracy: 68.42105263157895 %
test accuracy: 36.0 %

-------------------------------------------------------
```

> **Interpretation**: 
> 
> - Different learning rates give different costs and thus different predictions results.
> - If the learning rate is too large (0.01), the cost may oscillate up and down. It may even diverge (though in this example, using 0.01 still eventually ends up at a good value for the cost). 
> - A lower cost doesn't mean a better model. You have to check if there is possibly overfitting. It happens when the training accuracy is a lot higher than the test accuracy.
> - In deep learning, we usually recommend that you: 
>    - Choose the learning rate that better minimizes the cost function.
>    - If your model overfits, use other techniques to reduce overfitting. (We'll talk about this in later videos.)

<h3 id="8">8 - What to remember from this assignment</h3>

> **What to remember from this assignment:**
> 
> 1. Preprocessing the dataset is important.
> 2. You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(), optimize(). Then you built a model().
> 3. Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a "hyperparameter") can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples of this later in this course!
