<h3 id="00">Problem Statement</h3>

> - Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: 
>
> > - **Face Verification** - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. 
> > - **Face Recognition** - "who is this person?". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.
> 
> - FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

<h3 id="0">0 - Naive Face Verification</h3>

> - In Face Verification, you're given two images and you have to tell if they are of the same person. 
> - The simplest way to do this is to compare the two images pixel-by-pixel. If the distance between the raw images are less than a chosen threshold, it may be the same person! 
> - This algorithm performs really poorly, since the pixel values change dramatically due to variations in lighting, orientation of the person's face, even minor changes in head position, and so on.


<h3 id="1.1">1.1 - Using an ConvNet to compute encoding</h3>

> - just load weights that someone else has already trained. The network architecture follows the Inception model from [Szegedy *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842).
> - [什麼是Siamese network？](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Note/4-4.md#4.3.1)
> - This network uses 96x96 dimensional RGB images as its input. Specifically, inputs a face image (or batch of **m** face images) as a tensor of shape **(m, n_C, n_H, n_W) = (m, 3, 96, 96)**
> - It outputs a matrix of shape **(m, 128)** that encodes each input face image into a 128-dimensional vector

```python
FRmodel = faceRecoModel(input_shape=(3, 96, 96))
```

<h3 id="1.2">1.2 - The Triplet Loss</h3>

> - [理解triplet loss的核心部分？](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Note/4-4.md#4.4.1)
> Training will use triplets of images **(A, P, N)**:  
>
> > - A is an "Anchor" image--a picture of a person. 
> > - P is a "Positive" image--a picture of the same person as the Anchor image.
> > - N is a "Negative" image--a picture of a different person than the Anchor image.

def triplet_loss(y_true, y_pred, alpha = 0.2):
    """
    Implementation of the triplet loss as defined by formula (3)
    
    Arguments:
    y_true -- true labels, required when you define a loss in Keras, you don't need it in this function.
    y_pred -- python list containing three objects:
            anchor -- the encodings for the anchor images, of shape (None, 128)
            positive -- the encodings for the positive images, of shape (None, 128)
            negative -- the encodings for the negative images, of shape (None, 128)
    
    Returns:
    loss -- real number, value of the loss
    """
    
    anchor, positive, negative = y_pred[0], y_pred[1], y_pred[2]
    
    ### START CODE HERE ### (≈ 4 lines)
    # Step 1: Compute the (encoding) distance between the anchor and the positive
    pos_dist = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(anchor - positive))
    # Step 2: Compute the (encoding) distance between the anchor and the negative
    neg_dist = tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(anchor - negative))
    # Step 3: subtract the two previous distances and add alpha.
    basic_loss = pos_dist - neg_dist + alpha
    # Step 4: Take the maximum of basic_loss and 0.0. Sum over the training examples.
    loss = tf.maximum(basic_loss, 0)
    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    return loss
```

<h3 id="2">2 - Loading the trained model</h3>

> - FaceNet is trained by minimizing the triplet loss. But since training requires a lot of data and a lot of computation, we won't train it from scratch here. Instead, we load a previously trained model.

```python
FRmodel.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = triplet_loss, metrics = ['accuracy'])
load_weights_from_FaceNet(FRmodel)
``` 

<h3 id="3.1">3.1 - Face Verification</h3>

> - build a database containing one encoding vector for each person allowed to enter the happy house. To generate the encoding we use img_to_encoding(image_path, model) which basically runs the forward propagation of the model on the specified image.

```python
database = {}
database["danielle"] = img_to_encoding("images/danielle.png", FRmodel)
database["younes"] = img_to_encoding("images/younes.jpg", FRmodel)
database["tian"] = img_to_encoding("images/tian.jpg", FRmodel)
database["andrew"] = img_to_encoding("images/andrew.jpg", FRmodel)
database["kian"] = img_to_encoding("images/kian.jpg", FRmodel)
database["dan"] = img_to_encoding("images/dan.jpg", FRmodel)
database["sebastiano"] = img_to_encoding("images/sebastiano.jpg", FRmodel)
database["bertrand"] = img_to_encoding("images/bertrand.jpg", FRmodel)
database["kevin"] = img_to_encoding("images/kevin.jpg", FRmodel)
database["felix"] = img_to_encoding("images/felix.jpg", FRmodel)
database["benoit"] = img_to_encoding("images/benoit.jpg", FRmodel)
database["arnaud"] = img_to_encoding("images/arnaud.jpg", FRmodel)
```

**Exercise**: Implement the verify() function which checks if the front-door camera picture (`image_path`) is actually the person called "identity". You will have to go through the following steps:
1. Compute the encoding of the image from image_path
2. Compute the distance about this encoding and the encoding of the identity image stored in the database
3. Open the door if the distance is less than 0.7, else do not open.

As presented above, you should use the L2 distance (np.linalg.norm). (Note: In this implementation, compare the L2 distance, not the square of the L2 distance, to the threshold 0.7.)

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: verify

def verify(image_path, identity, database, model):
    """
    Function that verifies if the person on the "image_path" image is "identity".
    
    Arguments:
    image_path -- path to an image
    identity -- string, name of the person you'd like to verify the identity. Has to be a resident of the Happy house.
    database -- python dictionary mapping names of allowed people's names (strings) to their encodings (vectors).
    model -- your Inception model instance in Keras
    
    Returns:
    dist -- distance between the image_path and the image of "identity" in the database.
    door_open -- True, if the door should open. False otherwise.
    """
    
    ### START CODE HERE ###
    
    # Step 1: Compute the encoding for the image. Use img_to_encoding() see example above. (≈ 1 line)
    encoding = img_to_encoding(image_path, model)
    
    # Step 2: Compute distance with identity's image (≈ 1 line)
    dist = np.linalg.norm(database[identity] - encoding)
    
    # Step 3: Open the door if dist < 0.7, else don't open (≈ 3 lines)
    if dist < 0.7:
        print("It's " + str(identity) + ", welcome home!")
        door_open = True
    else:
        print("It's not " + str(identity) + ", please go away")
        door_open = False

    return dist, door_open
```

<h3 id="3.2">3.2 - Face Recognition</h3>

> - You'll implement a face recognition system that takes as input an image, and figures out if it is one of the authorized persons (and if so, who). Unlike the previous face verification system, we will no longer get a person's name as another input.

**Exercise**: Implement `who_is_it()`. You will have to go through the following steps:

1. Compute the target encoding of the image from image_path
2. Find the encoding from the database that has smallest distance with the target encoding. 
    - Initialize the `min_dist` variable to a large enough number (100). It will help you keep track of what is the closest encoding to the input's encoding.
    - Loop over the database dictionary's names and encodings. To loop use `for (name, db_enc) in database.items()`.
        - Compute L2 distance between the target "encoding" and the current "encoding" from the database.
        - If this distance is less than the min_dist, then set min_dist to dist, and identity to name.

```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: who_is_it

def who_is_it(image_path, database, model):
    """
    Implements face recognition for the happy house by finding who is the person on the image_path image.

    model -- your Inception model instance in Keras
    
    Returns:
    min_dist -- the minimum distance between image_path encoding and the encodings from the database
    identity -- string, the name prediction for the person on image_path

    # Initialize "min_dist" to a large value, say 100 (≈1 line)

        dist = np.linalg.norm(db_enc - encoding)

        # If this distance is less than the min_dist, then set min_dist to dist, and identity to name. (≈ 3 lines)
        if dist < min_dist:
            min_dist = dist
            identity = name

    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    if min_dist > 0.7:
        print("Not in the database.")
    else:
        print ("it's " + str(identity) + ", the distance is " + str(min_dist))
        
    return min_dist, identity
```
        

<h3 id="4">What you should remember</h3>

> - Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem; face recognition addresses a harder 1:K matching problem. 
> - The triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network to learn an encoding of a face image.
> - The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition. Measuring distances between two images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are pictures of the same person.
