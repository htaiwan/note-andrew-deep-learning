<h3 id="1">1 - Problem Statement</h3>

> - Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.

<h3 id="2">2 - Transfer Learning</h3>

> - Neural Style Transfer (NST) uses a previously trained convolutional network, and builds on top of that. 
> - The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.
> - Use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the earlier layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). 

```python
model = load_vgg_model("pretrained-model/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat")
```

**Exercise:** Compute the "content cost" using TensorFlow. 

**Instructions**: The 3 steps to implement this function are:

1. Retrieve dimensions from a_G: 
    - To retrieve dimensions from a tensor X, use: `X.get_shape().as_list()`
2. Unroll a_C and a_G as explained in the picture above
    - If you are stuck, take a look at [Hint1](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.3/api_docs/python/tf/transpose) and [Hint2](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/reshape).
3. Compute the content cost:
    - If you are stuck, take a look at [Hint3](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reduce_sum), [Hint4](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/square) and [Hint5](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/subtract).

# GRADED FUNCTION: compute_content_cost

**Exercise**:
Using TensorFlow, implement a function that computes the Gram matrix of a matrix A. The formula is: The gram matrix of A is G_A = AA^T If you are stuck, take a look at [Hint 1](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/matmul) and [Hint 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/transpose).

> - [如何定義style loss function](https://github.com/htaiwan/note-andrew-deep-learning/blob/master/Note/4-4.md#4.10.3)

**Exercise**: Compute the style cost for a single layer. 

**Instructions**: The 3 steps to implement this function are:

1. Retrieve dimensions from the hidden layer activations a_G: 
    - To retrieve dimensions from a tensor X, use: `X.get_shape().as_list()`
2. Unroll the hidden layer activations a_S and a_G into 2D matrices, as explained in the picture above.
    - You may find [Hint1](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.3/api_docs/python/tf/transpose) and [Hint2](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.2/api_docs/python/tf/reshape) useful.
3. Compute the Style matrix of the images S and G. (Use the function you had previously written.) 
4. Compute the Style cost:
    - You may find [Hint3](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/reduce_sum), [Hint4](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/square) and [Hint5](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/subtract) useful.

<h3 id="5">What you should remember</h3>

> - Neural Style Transfer is an algorithm that given a content image C and a style image S can generate an artistic image
> - It uses representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pretrained ConvNet. 
> - The content cost function is computed using one hidden layer's activations.
> - The style cost function for one layer is computed using the Gram matrix of that layer's activations. The overall style cost function is obtained using several hidden layers.
> - Optimizing the total cost function results in synthesizing new images.
